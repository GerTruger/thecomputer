                <strong>Hardware logic</strong> is primarily a differentiation of the data processing circuitry from other more generalized circuitry. 
                For example nearly all computers include a power supply which consists of circuitry not involved in data processing but rather powering the data processing circuits.
                Similarly, a computer may output information to a computer monitor or audio amplifier which is also not involved in the computational processes.
            </p>
            <p class="F">
                <strong>Electronic hardware</strong> consists of interconnected electronic components which perform analog or logic operations on received and locally stored information to produce as output or store resulting new information or to provide control for output actuator mechanisms.
                Electronic hardware can range from individual chips/circuits to distributed information processing systems.
                Well designed electronic hardware is composed of hierarchies of functional modules which inter-communicate via precisely defined interfaces.

            <p class="G">
                <strong>Computer hardware</strong> includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.
                By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.
                Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction.
                A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.

                <strong>Hardware upgrade</strong>
                When using computer hardware, an upgrade means adding new or additional hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features.
                For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the hard drive with a faster one or a Solid State Drive (SSD) to get a boost in performance. 
                The user may also install more Random Access Memory (RAM) so the computer can store additional temporary data, or retrieve such data at a faster rate. 
                The user may add a USB 3.0 expansion card to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for cleaner, more advanced graphics, or more monitors.
                Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for aged computers to meet a new, or updated program's system requirements.

                <strong>Recycling      
                Main article:</strong><br> Computer recycling  Because computer parts contain hazardous materials, there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts.<br>
                Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as: <br>lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium. According to the EPA these e-wastes have a harmful effect on the environment unless they are disposed of properly. 
                Making hardware requires energy, and recycling parts will reduce air pollution, water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Disposing unauthorized computer equipment is in fact illegal. Legislation makes it mandatory to recycle computers through the government approved facilities.
                 Recycling a computer can be made easier by taking out certain reusable parts. For example, the RAM, DVD drive, the graphics card, hard drive or SSD, and other similar removable parts can be reused.
                Many materials used in computer hardware can be recovered by recycling for use in future production. Reuse of tin, silicon, iron, aluminium, and a variety of plastics that are present in bulk in computers or other electronics can reduce the costs of constructing new systems. 
                Components frequently contain copper, gold, tantalum, silver, platinum, palladium, and lead as well as other valuable materials suitable for reclamation.
