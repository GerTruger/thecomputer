                A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 
                These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. 
                This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
                Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
                Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations.
                Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. 
                More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. 
                The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. 
                The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. 
                The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

                Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. 
                The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.
                Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen).
                Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

                A portion of Babbage's Difference engine.
                Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. 
                Considered the "father of the computer", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century.
                After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. 
                The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. 
                For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. 
                The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.
